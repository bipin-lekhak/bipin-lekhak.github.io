### A little personal update:

- Got tested positive for CoViD-19 this week
- No definitive source of infection that I know of
- Writing this journal to document my symptoms and experiences
- Will be WIP till I fully recover
- Since the course of infection to different people is different:
  - Do not expect to have the same experiences as me
  - **Please take advise** from trained medico or nurse or health advisory body such
    as the [Ministry of Health](https://heoc.mohp.gov.np/), [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/), etc.
