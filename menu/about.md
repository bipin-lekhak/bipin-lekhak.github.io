Hello World!!!

I am **Bipin**: a once insignificant little kid from a insignificant
little place, asking insignificant questions that annoyed my elders and
teachers.

## What I like

I like to question things: facts, assumptions and everything in between.

I like to confuse myself and remain confused.

## What I do

Since I completed undergrad in 2018, have been working in the field of Machine Learning/Data Science.

## Why this blog

Mostly for personnel reasons. I want to document my confusion, curiosity and
questions and leave it out in the open with a hope that the wonderful
inhabitants of this planet will help me learn, solve and satisfy my curiosity.

## Areas of Interest

- Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Signal Processing
- Curios about Physical and Life Sciences
- Football, Tennis and Cricket
- Dylan, Beatles, Queen
